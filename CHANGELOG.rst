Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
 - Fixed cases where number of mapped genes might be different when running smaller genomes individually vs grouped.
 - Fixed cases where gunc would fail if _-_ was in a sequence identifier.
 - Fixed cases where contig colour in visualisation was incorrect.
 - Fixed incorrect ordering of taxonomic levels in plot if user supplies them in an incorrect order.
 - Allow GUNC to continue if some genomes fail diamond mapping.
 - Fixed crash if diamond fails to map anything to GUNC reference.
 - Fixed bug where GUNC goes into infinite loop if an input filename is merged.fa

Other
^^^^^
 - class and order are now included in contig assignment output file (@aaronmussig)
 - Fix pandas deprecation waring (@tmaklin)
 - Added fixes for pandas FutureWarning (changing behaviour of Series.idxmax)

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

 - Added check if temp_dir exists before starting analysis.

Other
^^^^^
 - Removed dependency on `zgrep` (for compatability with nf-core tests)

v1.0.4
------

Features
^^^^^^^^

 - Added option to download GTDB_GUNC database
 - Input file options can be gene_calls (faa) instead of fna if `--gene_calls` flag is set
 - Input genecalls can be gzipped
 - Output maxCSS file is now sorted


Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

Other
^^^^^
 - Documentation updates
    - Links to synthetic datasets added
    - Citations for diamond and prodigal added
    - Clarified how checkM should be run for `checkm_merge`
    - Corrected command for `download_db`

v1.0.1
------

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
 - Running from genecounts failed
 - Fixed case where pass.GUNC output was converted to ints
 - Fixed silently ignoring input samples that did not map to reference

Other
^^^^^
 - Better error message if ouput_dir doesnt exist
 - Documentation updates

------

Features
^^^^^^^^
 - Added option to download the GUNC_DB file
 - Added option to merge GUNC output with checkM output
 - Added option to create interactive HTML based visualisation
 - Added option to run all fastas in a directory
 - Added option to provide input filepaths in a file

 - Can now accept gzipped fna files (with .gz ending)
 - Allow GUNC_DB to be supplied using an env var
 - Updated arguments to a subcommand structure
 - Complete rewrite of how scores are calculated
 - Gene calling is now done in parallel

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^
 - genome2taxonomy was not included in pip package
 - GUNC failed if nothing left after minor clade filtering
 - If duplicate filenames were in input, output files were overwritten
 - Inputs that dont map any genes to GUNC_DB were silently missing in output

Other
^^^^^
 - Documentation updates
